# Catalog of Enchantments / Curses

The following table describes each enchantment and curse introduced in Enchantology. For Enchantology tags, such as those that define incompatible enchantments (e.g., ```#enchantology:exclusive_set/education```), see the subsequent table. For default Minecraft tags (e.g., ```#minecraft:treasure```), see [the Minecraft Wiki.](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag_(Java_Edition))

If ```Treasure?``` == ```FALSE```, these enchantments can be found on random loot, fishing, and in the Enchanting Table. If ```TRUE```, these can only be acquired through fishing, dropped by certain mobs, or in various structures (see ```Found In``` column). Dexterity and Shattering are exceptions, as these can also be found on random loot.
